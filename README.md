# HW-WIREFRAME

I did not spend as much time as I wanted to on this assignment. I missed Saturday's class and working full time
does not grant me enough time this week. I will allocate more time to studying and figuring out how to replicate 
the portfolio. I tried to replicate the easier assignment, but I messed up because the article and aside would be different from the other containers on different browsers. I definitely will study more on how to align everything perfectly.
